# NotificationServiceDemo
This is a demo showing how to use Notification Service Extensions introduced with iOS 10.
I prepared this for a Cocoa Heads talk in Aachen. Here is my [presentation](http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=2580&download=y) for this.

# How to use?
In order to use this you should download [Knuff](https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff) for debugging push.
Also you need to set up the recieving of push from Apple APNs, if you don't know how please look [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/123862/push-notifications-tutorial).
But you only need to configure your push certificate, app id and so on. The code all ready tries to register for push.
